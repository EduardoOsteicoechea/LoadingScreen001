- Create the repository on github
- Set it as public
- Avoid specifying a liscence
- Do not add a readme file

   Create the readme file on the command line
echo "# LoadingScreen001" >> README.md

   Add all the files and subdirectories in the current directory to the local git staging area (temporal save before actually saving the changes to the local git storage with "git commit")
git add .

   Save the changes to the local git storage
git commit -m "first commit"

   Set the branch to main. "-M" means to inforce the action -> without this it could fail if the branch is already named with a different name
git branch -M main

   Add the web GitHub repository as the remote origin of the currently tracked repository
git remote add origin https://github.com/EduardoOsteicoechea/LoadingScreen001.git

   Push the currently tracked repository to GitHub
git push --set-upstream origin main
